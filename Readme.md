#ColorPalette Example

## Description
In this application, random color codes are generated and the color is shown on the screen. 
The purpose of the application is to make color choices and to reach the codes of these colors. 
Like other examples this app can be developed.
Clomosy code appears to be creating a form with three panels, each representing a color. 
The panels are clickable, and when clicked, they generate random hexadecimal colors and display them within the panels and labels. 
Additionally, the clicked color is copied to the clipboard.

## Variable_Declarations
Various variables (MyForm, color1Pnl, color2Pnl, etc.) are declared, representing the form, panels, labels, and color-related information.
##SetupFormLayout_Procedure
 Defines a procedure SetupFormLayout to set up the layout of the form.
##GenerateRandomHexColor_Function
Defines a function GenerateRandomHexColor to generate a random hexadecimal color.
##Panel_Click_Procedures
color1PnlOnClick, color2PnlOnClick, and color3PnlOnClick are procedures triggered when the respective panels are clicked. 
They generate a random color, update the panel and label properties, and set the form's color gradient.
##Label_Click_Procedures:
colorLblOnClick, colorLbl2OnClick, and colorLbl3OnClick are procedures triggered when the respective labels are clicked. They copy the label's text (color code) to the clipboard.
##Main_Code
Creates a new form (MyForm).
Sets up the initial color values and form layout.
Creates three panels (color1Pnl, color2Pnl, color3Pnl) and corresponding labels.
Sets up event handlers for panel clicks and label clicks.
Runs the form.
This code is likely part of a Delphi or Lazarus project using a custom framework or library (clComponent, clUtils, etc.). It provides a simple graphical interface for generating and displaying random colors, allowing users to interact with the form and copy color codes to the clipboard. The color panels and labels are styled with specific attributes such as size, alignment, and border properties.
